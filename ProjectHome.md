This project is just to demonstrate how to create a simple e-commerce shopping cart web based application using Java, Hibernate, JPA, and Struts 2. This is just a version 1. It only shows you the basic structure of how an e-commerce / shopping cart app looks like in general. It will include a very basic admin interface, along with the front end interface as well. Feel free to browse around at any time, and any comment, concern, questions, and feedback are welcome. Thank you.
